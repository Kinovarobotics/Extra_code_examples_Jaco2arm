# Extra_code_examples_Jaco2arm
This repo contains a few extra unofficial cpp code examples for the kinova arms (framework 2 generation)

Disclaimer: the codes in this repo have not been tested exhaustively like the examples in the Kinova SDK. They have been tested up to a certain extent and should be functional, but are intented as a reference and/or to get you started on your projects using the kinova arms. If you find a bug, please let us know, and we will try to fix it as fast as possible. Please also feel free to contribute your own code examples to this repo!

The cpp files can be integrated in a project (use your favorite IDE!). Be sure to update the libraries lookup paths such that they point on the right Kinova .so or .dll library files. You will also need the right Kinova header files (libraries and header files are downloadable from the Kinova website with the Kinova SDK). The examples have been tested with the latest version of the Kinova SDK (1.4.0).

You comments are welcome!
