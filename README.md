# Extra_code_examples_Jaco2arm
This repo contains a few extra unofficial .cpp code examples for the Kinova arms (Framework 2nd Generation)

*Disclaimer:* the code in this repo has not been tested exhaustively to the same extent as the examples in the Kinova SDK. They have been tested to a limited extent and should be functional. However, they are intended only as a reference and/or to get you started on your projects using the Kinova arms. If you find a bug, please let us know, and we will try to fix it as fast as possible. Also, please feel free to contribute your own code examples to this repo!

The .cpp files can be integrated in a project (use your favorite IDE!). Be sure to update the libraries' lookup paths such that they point on the right Kinova .so or .dll library files. You will also need the right Kinova header files (libraries and header files are downloadable from the Kinova website through the Kinova SDK). These examples have been tested with the latest version of the Kinova SDK (1.4.0).

You comments are welcome!
